# RHadoopML-Project

This project is an introduction to using the Hadoop platform, R programming language, and the application of MapReduce. Once the data required is obtained, machine learning will be used to analyze the data. 

RHadoop Code: This was the code used to import, filter, and save the data using R and Hadoop. All the data regarding patients who would be classified as having respiratory diseases based on 'diag_1' tests were extracted. That data was split into two based on where they were discharged to go home or not.
